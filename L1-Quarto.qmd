# My first Quarto Project

## PhD life
Life as PhD can be **hard**.

Especially if you need to be fluent in programming languages, which I'm not.

Luckily, there is a whole community who can help you. Just have a look [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions)

![Then you can attend nice summerschool and learn how to use these programs](img/rq.png)
